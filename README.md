# Spruce Loader
**The Minecraft mod loader that makes a difference.**

</div>

## What is this?

Spruce Loader is a Minecraft mod loader which fixes issues that
other mod loaders have overlooked in the past, and pretty much
reinvents the wheel to do so. The entire project is written from
scratch, aside from borrowing a few small components from existant
loaders. 

We take the best aspects of both Fabric and Forge and combine
them into one beautifully executed mod loader which fits all
your needs, whether you're a user or a developer. This means we
also include a massive built-in API (no additional mods for this!)
to make mods not just more stable, but significantly easier to make.

Spruce Loader also contains additional very useful features which
other mod loader simply lack, such as optional built-in mods
which make it easier to use the loader itself. These include
things like a mod menu.

You'll see more info here as we progress with the project's
lifecycle. Join [our Discord server][discord] to keep up with
any updates!

## How do I run it?
As of right now, Spruce Loader is not available for use as a
user. If you're a developer, it is possible to run the loader
from within the project itself using the automatically generated
IntelliJ IDEA run configurations.
