# [`UniLoader`]
The Minecraft mod loader that makes a difference.

</div>

## What is this?

UniLoader is a Minecraft mod loader which fixes issues that
other mod loaders have overlooked in the past, and pretty much
reinvents the wheel to do so.

We take the best aspects of both Fabric and Forge and combine
them into one beautifully executed mod loader which fits all
your needs, whether you're a user or a developer.

UniLoader also contains additional very useful features which
other mod loader simply lack, such as optional built-in mods
which make it easier to use the loader itself. These include
things like a built-in mod browser (powered by [Modrinth][mr])
and mod menu.

You'll see more info here as we progress with the project's
lifecycle. Join [our Discord server][discord] to keep up with
any updates!

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL!**

## How do I run it?
Currently, UniLoader is very WIP and cannot be used. We'll update
this file as soon as it's possible to test things out.
